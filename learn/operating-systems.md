There are many operating systems available to meet different needs. Some are more difficult to administer than others, but there should be a solution available for whatever you want to do.

While paying for a licensed product is always an option if you find the value in said product worth the cost, it is recommended to make sure that a "free" solution could not meet the same needs.

#### Proprietary / Licensed

- [Microsoft Windows Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/) | Windows is not usually chosen due to licensing costs.
- [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) | Linux-based, but requires the purchase of a license for usage past the trial period.

#### Entry Level / Easy

These are operating systems that are administered with a GUI/web-based frontend to focus on ease of use.
